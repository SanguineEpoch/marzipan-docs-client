It’s a <strong>source-available</strong>, <strong>ethics-driven</strong> language that invites collaboration without leaving itself open to exploitation.</p><hr><h2>⚖️ Licensing Model</h2><p>Marzipan uses a <strong>dual license</strong> that distinguishes between general usage and responsibility-triggering use.</p><h3>✅ You can freely use Marzipan if:</h3><ul><li>You’re building games, tools, apps, or services — commercial or not</li><li>Your use does <strong>not</strong> involve advanced runtime reflection, self-modifying behavior, or agent-like introspection</li><li>You’re using Marzipan in open-source projects, personal experiments, or small-scale commercial tools</li></ul><p>You don’t owe anything. Build freely.</p><hr><h3>❗ You need a license if:</h3><ul><li><p>You’re using <strong>Marzipan’s advanced features</strong>:</p><ul><li>Runtime AST manipulation</li><li>Self-shaping runtimes</li><li>Dynamic execution pipelines</li><li>Deep introspection for adaptation or control</li></ul></li><li><p>And your project is:</p><ul><li>Commercial, large-scale, or widely deployed</li><li>Using those features in ways that grant significant advantage, influence, or capability</li><li>Operating in high-stakes domains (e.g. automation, surveillance, AGI-adjacent work)</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>This isn’t about blocking innovation. It’s about asking those who benefit most from Marzipan’s deepest powers to help sustain and protect the ecosystem that gave them that power.</p></blockquote><hr><h2>💸 Income Model</h2><p>Any income generated by Marzipan will follow a clear pipeline:</p><ol><li><strong>Sustain Marzipan’s Core</strong><ul><li>Infrastructure, docs, development</li></ul></li><li><strong>Support the Creator</strong><ul><li>Health, safety, and the ability to live with dignity — not just survival</li></ul></li><li><strong>Grow the Ecosystem</strong><ul><li>Outreach, design, educational content, tooling, partnerships</li></ul></li><li><strong>Give Back to the Community</strong><ul><li>Bounties, grants, contributor support, open project funding</li></ul></li></ol><blockquote><p>This isn’t VC-backed or profit-maximized. Marzipan is a community-aligned tool with a community-first funding philosophy.</p></blockquote><hr><h2>🔄 License Evolution</h2><p>The license may evolve over time — with notice — to address new edge cases, close loopholes, and stay aligned with Marzipan’s ethics.</p><ul><li>Changes will be communicated clearly</li><li>They won’t be applied retroactively without serious cause</li><li>They won’t be used to lock users in or shift goals unfairly</li></ul><blockquote><p>The right to update the license exists not to seize control, but to <strong>protect what makes Marzipan fair</strong> — even when the world changes.</p></blockquote><hr><h2>🧠 Why This Exists</h2><p>Marzipan gives developers real power — the ability to shape runtimes, introspect code, and build systems that evolve over time. That power should benefit the many, <strong>not just the well-resourced few</strong>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>You can build and sell software with Marzipan without restriction.</strong><br> But if you’re using Marzipan’s inner magic to build something powerful enough to reshape workflows, systems, or influence — we ask you to support the project that made it possible.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Marzipan is power.
