# The Marzipan License Philosophy

> **Marzipan is power.**  
> It was created to help people build what matters — not to hand more power to those who already have it.

Marzipan is built in the spirit of open source — but with a license that protects contributors, the commons, and the future of the project. It’s a **source-available**, **ethics-driven** language that invites collaboration without leaving itself open to exploitation.

## ⚖️ Licensing Model

Marzipan uses a **dual license** that distinguishes between general usage and responsibility-triggering use.

### ✅ You can freely use Marzipan if:

- You’re building games, tools, apps, or services — commercial or not
- Your use does **not** involve advanced runtime reflection, self-modifying behavior, or agent-like introspection
- You’re using Marzipan in open-source projects, personal experiments, or small-scale commercial tools

You don’t owe anything. Build freely.

### ❗ You need a license if:

- You’re using **Marzipan’s advanced features**:

  - Runtime AST manipulation
  - Self-shaping runtimes
  - Dynamic execution pipelines
  - Deep introspection for adaptation or control

- And your project is:
  - Commercial, large-scale, or widely deployed
  - Using those features in ways that grant significant advantage, influence, or capability
  - Operating in high-stakes domains (e.g. automation, surveillance, AGI-adjacent work)

> This isn’t about blocking innovation. It’s about asking those who benefit most from Marzipan’s deepest powers to help sustain and protect the ecosystem that gave them that power.

## 💸 Income Model

Any income generated by Marzipan will follow a clear pipeline:

1. **Sustain Marzipan’s Core**
   - Infrastructure, docs, development
2. **Support the Creator**
   - Health, safety, and the ability to live with dignity — not just survival
3. **Grow the Ecosystem**
   - Outreach, design, educational content, tooling, partnerships
4. **Give Back to the Community**
   - Bounties, grants, contributor support, open project funding

> This isn’t VC-backed or profit-maximized. Marzipan is a community-aligned tool with a community-first funding philosophy.

---

## 🔄 License Evolution

The license may evolve over time — with notice — to address new edge cases, close loopholes, and stay aligned with Marzipan’s ethics.

- Changes will be communicated clearly
- They won’t be applied retroactively without serious cause
- They won’t be used to lock users in or shift goals unfairly

> The right to update the license exists not to seize control, but to **protect what makes Marzipan fair** — even when the world changes.

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Marzipan gives developers real power — the ability to shape runtimes, introspect code, and build systems that evolve over time. That power should benefit the many, **not just the well-resourced few**.

> **You can build and sell software with Marzipan without restriction.**  
> But if you’re using Marzipan’s inner magic to build something powerful enough to reshape workflows, systems, or influence — we ask you to support the project that made it possible.

> Marzipan is power. Let’s use it to lift up the open, the small, and the brave.
