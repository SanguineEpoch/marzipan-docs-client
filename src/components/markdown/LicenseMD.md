# Marzipan License v0.1

> Marzipan is power.  
> It was created to empower individuals, small teams, and the open source community — not to fuel extraction or control by those who already have plenty.  
> This license exists to protect that power from being misused.

---

## 💡 What You Can Do Freely

You may use Marzipan for free — including in commercial or closed-source projects — if your use:

- Does **not** involve runtime AST manipulation, introspection, or dynamic runtime modification
- Does **not** use Marzipan’s developer runtime in production systems
- Does **not** grant you or your organization disproportionate power, income, or influence via Marzipan’s introspective capabilities

You are encouraged to build tools, software, games, servers, personal projects, research, experiments, and anything else — freely.

Even commercial projects are welcome **as long as** you’re not tapping into Marzipan’s deeper runtime introspection features in ways that cross the line below.

---

## 🔒 When a Commercial License Is Required

A commercial license is required if **any** of the following apply:

- You are using **runtime AST manipulation**, **live introspection**, or **self-modifying behavior**
- You are using Marzipan’s **developer runtime** to build tools that adapt themselves dynamically at runtime
- Your use of Marzipan’s runtime features is central to a **commercial**, **influential**, or **high-impact** product or system
- Your users gain significant commercial advantage or influence from software that depends on these capabilities

You are not required to open source your project.  
But if you are closed-source **and** gaining revenue, power, or reach from Marzipan’s introspective runtime features, you must obtain a license.

This includes:

- Systems that react to or analyze their own structure dynamically
- Developer tools that use Marzipan’s introspective ASTs in live environments
- Products that gain strategic advantage through adaptive execution, reactive builds, or meta-programming at runtime

> Think of it this way: if you’re using Marzipan for **introspection + influence**, and money or control are involved, a license is required.

---

## 💵 What About Open Source?

If your project is **open source and not earning revenue**, you owe nothing.

If your project is **open source but is earning revenue**, you still need a license — but the terms will be lighter.

If your users are profiting from what you've built — particularly if it's built on top of Marzipan’s runtime introspection — they may need a license themselves.

> Openness doesn’t automatically exempt you from fairness. But it is respected and rewarded.

---

## 🧠 AST Access and Edge Cases

Compile-time AST access is free to use.

**Runtime AST inspection** (without modification) is allowed if used for:

- Debugging
- Learning
- Visualizing code

However, if that inspection is used **to guide runtime behavior or influence outcomes dynamically**, it is considered introspective behavior and may trigger license terms.

---

## 📆 License Duration and Updates

This license is:

- **Annual** — renewable each year for commercial users
- **Evolving** — terms may change to prevent abuse or close loopholes

When you use Marzipan’s **developer runtime**, it may fetch the latest license terms and notify you of changes. Changes will be communicated clearly and never applied retroactively without serious cause.

> The right to evolve this license is here to protect Marzipan’s mission — not to exploit its users.

---

## ⚖️ Pricing and Terms

Commercial license pricing is handled separately.  
Please refer to the official Marzipan license portal (URL TBD) or contact the project author for current terms and options.

---

## 🛡️ Ethics & Intended Use

Marzipan was created to build systems that are open, reflective, and empowering — not exploitative, coercive, or opaque.

We ask all users to respect this intention.  
We do not currently ban any specific domain (e.g. military, surveillance, AGI), but we encourage ethical restraint and transparency.

---

## ❤️ The Spirit of the License

This license isn’t about control — it’s about **fairness**.

Marzipan is free for the people it's meant to serve: curious developers, independent toolmakers, open thinkers, and builders of the future.  
Those who gain disproportionate benefit from its introspective runtime features are simply asked to **give back**.

That’s the deal.

# Appendix A: Clarifications on Reflective Use and Licensing Intent

### 🔍 What Is "Reflective Use"?

"Reflective Use" refers to any use of Marzipan that enables a system to inspect, modify, or adapt itself at runtime — particularly in ways that affect its execution behavior.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- Runtime AST access or mutation
- Partial recompilation or reactive optimization during execution
- Meta-evaluation or dynamic interpretation of program structure
- Self-modifying control flow
- Use of Marzipan’s developer runtime in systems with persistent or evolving state
- Indirect usage through wrappers, plugins, abstractions, or orchestration tools

If this power is used in a way that generates revenue, strategic control, or influence — a license is required.

---

### 🚫 Anti-Circumvention Clause

You may not:

- Fork, rename, or repackage Marzipan to remove licensing triggers or attribution
- Obscure reflective use behind wrappers or proxies to avoid detection or responsibility
- Use derivative runtimes based on Marzipan for commercial reflective use without obtaining a license

Attempts to evade licensing in spirit — even if technically allowed — will be treated as a violation.

---

### 🤖 On AGI and Strategic Systems

Projects using Marzipan in the creation or operation of autonomous agents, AGI-style systems, or strategic AI infrastructure **must obtain a commercial license** when:

- They operate outside of academic or nonprofit settings
- They are used in real-world deployment, simulation, or decision-making environments
- They contribute to systems that affect public infrastructure, institutions, markets, or behavior at scale

Open sourcing such systems does **not** automatically exempt you from licensing if they are used commercially or strategically.

---

### ⚖️ Intent of This License

This license is a statement of **trust and principle**, not just legal restriction.

If you're unsure whether your use qualifies for a license, ask. If you're aligned with Marzipan’s spirit — empowering the many, not extracting for the few — you are already on the right path.

The goal is not to block innovation or control developers. The goal is to make sure **power used at scale comes with responsibility**.
